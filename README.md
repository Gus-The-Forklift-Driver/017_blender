### **This is still a WIP**

This is my own implementation of [the wave function algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)
It needs the dataset to be created by hand, then automatically detects the matching tiles.
## todo
- more user friendly dataset matching edit
- improve performance
- reformat code and comments
- create propper user interface
